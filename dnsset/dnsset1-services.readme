It's a script, that will override dnscrypt-proxy and dnsmasq services.
You will need both of them installed and configured similiar to mine.
If you want to use my configs, copy them to /etc and /etc/dnscrypt-proxy/ respectively. For facebook to work with this dnsmasq.conf, remove dns-hijack options for it's domains in dnsmasq.conf (address=/facebook.net/127.0.0.1 like).
If you use a firewall, allow local (for dns caching on 53000 port) and input on 53/tcp and 53/udp ports for dns service.
